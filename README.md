## About this plugin

This repository contains the REST API Plugin v1 for phpList 3. It is contained
within the `plugins` folder, along with respective documentation and
plugin-specific tests.




## About the REST API plugin v2

v2 of the REST API plugin builds on phpList 4. It is under active development
and should be used and extended where possible.

It lives in a [separate repository](https://github.com/phpList/rest-api).

There also is an old, unfinished implementation of the REST API plugin v2 in
the directory [plugins/restapi2/](plugins/restapi2). This implementation will
be removed soon.
